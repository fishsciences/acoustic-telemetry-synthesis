# Distance Matrix calcs

## In the clean_all_detects.R script:
 # - only need fish (JSATS) from: 2013, 2016, and 2017
 # - only need fish (all groups) that reach either Ben or Chipps recs
 # - End Recs: "BeniciaW"  "ChippsW"
 # - Rename some receiver locations to agree with the names in the distance matrices

#-------------------------------------------------------#
# Objective:  using the detections and the distance matrices appropriate to a fish's route, calculate the distance traveled by each fish on each day.  

# If detections are separated by many days, spread the distance evenly across the interval.

# Final Final Output needed: tabular form, column for each FishID, row for each day, distance (abs(distance_traveled_in_meters))) in each cell. Different files for each year - 3 years (2013, 2016, 2017) - water year is fine.

#-------------------------------------------------------#
# Re-factored approach to creating distance traveled matrix: dbd_allfish function
#-------------------------------------------------------#

# 1. order detections by FishID and date; filter down to the first detection at each receiver

# 2. create lagged detection columns; create movement column by pasting

# 3. join with distance matrix data to get distance each movement represents

# group by fishID & date; the total distance traveled column = the distance traveled from the previous recorded movement to that date

# 4. Create column of lagged difftime = number of days elapsed since recorded previous movement

# 5. create vector of full dates in between recorded detections for a given movement

# 6. create vector of corresponding distances per day by dividing total distance by difftime

# 7. join to a final data frame
